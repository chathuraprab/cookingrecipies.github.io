        <p>Sri Lankan Coconut Sambol (pol Sambola/ pol sambal) is the unofficial national dish in Sri Lankan in my opinion. It’s so popular that you wouldn’t find any Sri Lankan who hasn’t love this. This is my ultimate comfort food. And definitely a food that I cannot live without. When I went for vacations or even after a long flight, or whenever I feel sick and when I have no appetite, coconut sambol/sambal and warm rice is the only thing I want to eat. The best thing about coconut Sambol/Sambal is, it doesn’t take 10mins to make this. Seriously. You can make this even before your rice is cooked.</p>
