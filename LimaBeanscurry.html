    <br>
    <li>Add all the ingredients mentioned above, (except for the thick coconut milk), into the pot with the lima beans</li>
    <br>
    <li>Mix the ingredients well to ensure they are evenly distributed throughout the beans.</li>
    <br>

    <br>
    <li>Once the beans are cooked to your satisfaction, it’s time to add the thick coconut milk. Pour it into the pot and stir gently to combine.</li>
    <br>
    <li>As the coconut milk starts to boil, remove the curry from the stove. If you prefer a drier consistency, you can continue to cook for a few more minutes until the excess liquid evaporates. Or adjust the curry/gravy for your preferred thickness.</li>
    <br>
    <li>Your Lima Beans Curry is now ready to be served. This delightful dish pairs perfectly with plain rice and other side dishes.</li>
